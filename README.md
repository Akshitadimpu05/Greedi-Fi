# 🚀 Greedi-Fi – Full-Stack Crypto Derivatives Trading Platform

## 📌 Project Description

**Greedi-Fi** is a full-stack, high-performance crypto derivatives trading platform built in C++ and modern web technologies. It enables automated, manual, and algorithmic trading on **testnet environments**, offering institutional-grade functionality. The platform supports placing/modifying/canceling orders, real-time order book visualization, position monitoring, and trade analytics. Engineered with low-latency trading logic and robust API communication, it replicates real-world trading systems used by professional firms.

A sleek web frontend integrates with the backend to provide real-time UI for traders, with live updates powered by WebSockets and historical insights visualized via interactive charts. Built with scalability and modularity in mind, EdgeTrade is deployable as a standalone app or extendable to support multiple crypto derivatives exchanges.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Git
- Terminal access

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Greedi-Fi.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Greedi-Fi
```

### Build and Run the Application

```bash
# Build all containers (this may take a few minutes the first time)
docker compose build

# Run the application
docker compose up
```

### Access the Application

Once the containers are running, you can access the different components:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### Stopping the Application

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker compose up is running
# or run this in a new terminal
docker compose down
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Redis Connection Error**: Make sure the redis service is up and running
- **Missing Libraries**: The Docker setup should handle all dependencies
- **Port Conflicts**: If ports 3000, 6379, or 8000 are in use, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to remap them
